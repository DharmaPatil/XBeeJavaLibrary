<p style="text-align: justify;">The XBee Java Library is an easy to use API developed in Java that allows you to interact with the XBee radio frequency (RF) modules produced by Digi. The XBee Java Library can be used to create any kind of Java application (from command line to GUI) that needs to communicate with or configure XBee devices.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The API has been designed both for new and advanced users. It is, you don't need any previous knowledge about XBee communication protocols or advanced Java experience, the API provides all the  methods you need to perform the most common tasks related to XBee devices. In the other hand, advanced users can use all the basic features provided by the library and take advantage of a set of flexible methods and listeners that will allow them to create powerful applications.</p>
